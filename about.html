		<p>At best, I am a <span>passionate builder</span>. I build software, companies, communities, and people. I aim to design world-class products that <i>ooze</i> excellence and perfection by imperfection. I work hard to <i>listen</i> and to <i>innovate</i> every day.</p>
		<p>During my career to date, I have built three startups (one w/ seed investment), built circa. 50 projects, received numerous mentions, attended 3 events & 9 hackathons (and won 3) and a <a href='http://devcsi.ukoln.ac.uk/2012/02/16/best-of-dev8d-the-award-ceremony-live-blog/' target='_blank' alt='Best of Dev8D: The Award Ceremony Live Blog' title='Best of Dev8D: The Award Ceremony Live Blog'>"Top Developer" award by Dev8D</a>.</p>

As impressive as it is, I haven't made <i>any</i> real, life-changing impact from my work. Until I do, it has minimal value for me.</p>

		<p>I love startups. I'm glad that it's now the social norm to be an entrepreneur, with minimal investment and risk. I try my best to make mistakes, learn from them, and tell stories to people. I want to spread the freedom of running a startup. I know that, one day in the future, I will start another company.</p>

		<p>In my day-to-day, I am studying for a Computer Science degree. I spend the majority of my free time exploring the world. I would normally recite a plentiful of clich&eacute;s concerning the meaning of life, but I figured you're too cool for that. On that note, I also try to make it easier for people to learn.</p>

		<p>I constantly maintain my health through gym, football and meditation. I'm an avid <a href="http://www.manutd.com/" target="_blank" title="Manchester United" alt="Manchester United">Manchester United</a> but an even bigger <a href="p:htt//www.fcbarcelona.com" target="_blank" title="FC Barcelona" alt="FC Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a> fan, and I play 5-a-side football regularly. I'm also exploring meditation as a way to think smarter, not harder.</p>
