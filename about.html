		<p>At best, I am a <span>passionate builder</span>. I build software, companies, communities, and people. I aim to design world-class products that <i>ooze</i> excellence and perfection by imperfection. I work hard to <i>listen</i> and to <i>innovate</i> every day.</p>
		<p>During my career to date, I have built three startups (one w/ seed investment), built circa. 50 projects, received numerous mentions, attended 3 events & 9 hackathons (and won 3) and a <a href='http://devcsi.ukoln.ac.uk/2012/02/16/best-of-dev8d-the-award-ceremony-live-blog/' target='_blank' alt='Best of Dev8D: The Award Ceremony Live Blog' title='Best of Dev8D: The Award Ceremony Live Blog'>"Top Developer" award by Dev8D</a>.</p>

As impressive as it is, I haven't made <i>any</i> real, life-changing impact from my work. Until I do, it has minimal value for me.</p>
		
		<p>I've always loved entrepreneurship. To me, it offers the greatest freedom that your work life can ever offer. I work hard to make mistakes (and learn from them) so I can have stories to tell. I most certainly will pursue another startup one day, when I have the right team and idea.</p>

		<p>In my day-to-day, I am studying full-time for a Computer Science degree. Beyond that, I travel across the world to learn and explore culture and people. By standard, I would recite a couple of clich&eacute;s about the philosophy of life, but you're too cool for that. I also try to make it easier for people to learn.</p>

		<p>I love live music, video games, gadgets and philosophy. I keep fit through regular 5-a-side football and gym. I'm a huge <a href="http://www.fcbarcelona.com" target="_blank" title="FC Barcelona" alt="FC Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a> football fan (and I also support <a href="http://www.manutd.com/" target="_blank" title="Manchester United" alt="Manchester United">Manchester United</a>). I'm always going to live music gigs and events, having been to 10 already over the years.</p>
