title: Bye WordPress, Hello Jekyll

excerpt: Today, I moved my blog from WordPress to Amazon S3 on Jekyll, a static-site generator built by Tom Preston-Werner, the co-founder of GitHub.

Today, I moved my [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) blog to [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). It's one of the best decisions I've made for my blogging. Jekyll is a blog-aware, static-site generator built in Ruby by [Tom Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com). I actually had an idea similar to Jekyll about 2 years ago, but I never got the chance to hack on it and so I suggested it at a hackathon I recently attended in Manchester; everyone directed me to Jekyll. That was when I first heard of Jekyll, and shortly after, I knew it was worth a try. After much deliberation about going live with it, I pushed it and I'm not looking back.

So, why do I love Jekyll? *It is perfect by being imperfect* (you'll hear me saying that a lot). Jekyll isn't intuitive, but it is simple. Similarly, it's not popular, but it's incredibly stable. Within a few hours of building my new site, I knew this was exactly what I envisioned all those years ago. I can confidently say that I won't be going back to WordPress, ever (unless I'm held captive). I've quickly seen that WordPress has quickly grown into a content management system (or CMS) that's competing with the likes of Magento, Drupal and Joomla in efforts to boost its possible use cases (especially for the larger sites). I understand why, because that's where *the money is*, but as a long adopter, I feel like WordPress has lost its roots. *It's too good for it's own good*. I hate that I become distracted trying to see what new plugins and themes are available, even though I updated it last week. Computationally, without a doubt, it definitely makes it easier to blog. Psychologically, on the other hand, is what I'm questioning. I obviously think the latter is of bigger importance.

After writing my first blog post, I realized that I *could* concentrate on my content. I remember on WordPress, where I would always have nothing written up during those free hours I had to commit and to not have distractions is when you realize you didn't need those "convenient" features. Writing, like many human tasks in the digital age, require **isolation for concentration**. It's already well-publicized that humans have the [same attention span as goldfish](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/1834682.stm), so it would be pretty obvious to remove any potential distractions unless it's **really** (x 10&#94;10) mandatory.

I strongly believe the popularity of static-site generators like Jekyll will surge in popularity between 2013-14. We've already seen JavaScript and CSS3 capable of replacing server-side features such as [Disqus](http://disqus.com), [Livefyre](http://livefyre.com), [Facebook Comments](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments/), etc.) and analytics ([Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com), [Mixpanel](http://mixpanel.com), etc. I'm hosting my blog using [AppFog](http://appfog.com), though you're free to use GitHub Pages or Amazon S3. Benefits of using Jekyll are it becomes infinitely scalable, super-fast to render, higher uptime, easier to maintain and of course &mdash; increased focus!

Even though I'm a newbie at Jekyll, I have instantaneously felt its part in boosting my focus and productivity. Mix Jekyll with [iA Writer](http://informationarchitects.net) and you'll write some fantastic stuff. I've even freely published the source powering this website [on GitHub](http://github.com/bih/bilaw.al). You'll be surprised by how easier your life becomes when **it is not possible** to be distracted by software.
