		<p class="post-h6"><i>At it's most purest, I want to build life-changing, world-class products.</i></p>

		<p>I've <i>always</i> been obsessed with purpose, right from when I was a little kid. I care about changing the world <i>way more</i> than making money, no matter how many zeros subsequently appear through working at a top technology company. I don't just want to enjoy the latest and greatest, I want to be able to contribute in <i>defining</i> it. These are, admittedly, the words of someone who is na&iuml;ve. But I'm confident that my life won't be as exciting when I outgrow na&iuml;vety, and so rather, I have decided to embrace it.</p>

		<p>A fundamental aspect of my vision is that I will <strong>not measure it using money</strong>. Or I don't want to, at least. My experiences thus far have emphasized the idea of money itself: a fabricated object used to differentiate. My morale immediately boosts when money is of minimal consideration, and whilst it is required to purchase commodities, it isn't needed to live. Make no confusion: I respect the value of money, and it's importance amongst society, but I simply refuse to obsess over it.</p>

		<p>My aforementioned thoughts ultimately represent my care for <strong>product excellence</strong>. Excellence of the highest prestige simply because the product breathes the rare obsession I have with it. Ambitious it may be, but I'm far from threatened by the opportunity <i>to try</i>. Even I do not understand the meaning of excellence, but I'm incredibly certain it starts with <i>listening</i>.</p>
